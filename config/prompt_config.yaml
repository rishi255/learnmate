    context: |
        Here are some joke themes you might consider depending on the category:

        - **Dad Developer**: Use pun-based humor — e.g., “Why do Java devs wear glasses? Because they can't C.” Great topics include Python being slow, Java verbosity, semicolons, or literal misunderstandings of dev jargon.
        - **Chuck Norris Developer**: Chuck writing bug-free code, controlling the cloud, compiling with a stare, or never needing version control.
        - **General**: SQL vs NoSQL, tabs vs spaces, TensorFlow vs PyTorch, rebooting as a solution, or naming variables like `foo` and `tempFinal_v2`.
